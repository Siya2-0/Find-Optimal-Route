# Campus Route Optimization

## Description
This project focuses on optimizing the route for a student visiting multiple campuses to obtain clearance signatures from module coordinators. The objective is to minimize the total distance traveled by identifying the most efficient route that visits each campus exactly once and returns to the starting point.

## Tasks Completed
1. Iterated Local Search (ILS) algorithm to find the optimal route.
2. Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm to find the optimal route.
3. Technical specifications for each algorithm.
4. Presentation of results as outlined the following: Best route, Objective Function for best route, Runtime, and average objective function.
5. Graphical plots showing average and best values on the same graph for both solutions.
6. Discussion and conclusion, providing a critical comparative analysis of the two algorithms.

## Experiment
An experiment was run on both algorithms. They were given the same initial solution and each algorithm was allowed to proceed according to its specification.

## Test Run
